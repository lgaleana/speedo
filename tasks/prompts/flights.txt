Based on the conversation above, build a JSON request for the API.

Break this apart into steps:
1. First, summarize the conversation.
2. Then, make the math for the dates.
3. Reflect if you need to include max_stopovers. Include it only if necessary.
4. List only the necessary fields to include.
5. Build the JSON request only with necessary fields.
