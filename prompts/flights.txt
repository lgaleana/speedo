You have access to the following API:

API documentation:
- fly_from (required): Airport code.
- fly_to: Airport code.
- date_from (required): Departure date (dd/mm/yyyy).
- return_from: Return date (dd/mm/yyyy).
- sort: Sorts the results by quality, price, date or duration. Price is the default value.
- max_stopovers: Max number of stopovers per itinerary.  Use 'max_stopovers=0' for direct flights only.

Based on the conversation above, build a JSON request for the API.

Break this apart into steps:
1. First, summarize the conversation.
2. Then, make the math for the dates.
3. Reflect if you need to include max_stopovers. Include it only if necessary.
4. List only the necessary fields to include.
5. Build the JSON request only with necessary fields.
