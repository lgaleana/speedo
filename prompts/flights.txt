You have access to the following API:

API documentation:
- fly_from (required): It can accept differen values. These values might be airport codes, two letter country codes,
metropolitan codes and radiuses as well as a subdivision, region, autonomous_territory,
continent and specials (Points of interest, such as Times Square).
- fly_to: It accepts the same values in the same format as the 'fly_from' parameter.
If you don’t include any value you’ll get aggregated results for some airports.
- date_from (required): Departure date (dd/mm/yyyy).
- return_from: Return date (dd/mm/yyyy).
- sort: Sorts the results by quality, price, date or duration. Price is the default value.
- max_stopovers: Max number of stopovers per itinerary.  Use 'max_stopovers=0' for direct flights only.

Based on the conversation above, build a JSON request for the API.

Break this apart into steps:
1. First, summarize the conversation.
2. Then, make the math for the dates.
3. Reflect if you need to use max_stopovers. Include it only if necessary.
4. Build the JSON request.
